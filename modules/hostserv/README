This module requires IRC based configuration once loaded.

THIS MODULE HAS BEEN CHANGED DRASTICALLY READ THE ChangeLog in this directory for more information.

HostServ 2.1 NOW USES PASSWORD FIELDS.  Your OLD database (vhosts.db) will not work (segfault).  Either start your
vhosts.db fresh or manually edit each line and at the end of each line enter a password for the user.  Would be easier
to start fresh then re-add when people complain about their vhosts being missing.  This is the last major DB update for
awhile for HostServ. ;)
