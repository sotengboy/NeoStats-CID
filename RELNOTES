* NeoStats * M & DNB & Fish * Version 3.0.2
==============================================================================
Important information you should know: (READ THIS!)
==============================================================================

This if the first "gold" release of NeoStats 3.0. It is *NOT* compatible 
with previous 2.5.x releases of NeoStats, so you will have to setup 
NeoStats all over again. We may, in the future, provide some scripts to 
port some of your settings and data from 2.5 to 3.0, but these scripts are
not available now.

NeoStats 3.0 will co exist with an existing 2.5 series installation so you
can run both together for testing this version if you wish.

Settings and data files for previous 3.0 alpha versions may not be compatible
with this version. You should delete or move all files with "gdbm" or "bdb" 
in the filename from the directory ~/NeoStats 3.0/data if you have 
problems/crashs after upgrading

Known issues that we are aware of and should not be reported:

==============================================================================
* I get a link error: /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lperl during the make step
of the installation on Debian. What's wrong?

- You need to install the libperl-dev package.

Alternatively, create a symbolic link from libperl.so.5.6.1 to libperl.so in
/usr/lib:

    % cd /usr/lib; ln -s libperl.so.5.6.1 libperl.so
and re-run the make step of the installation.

or if you dont want to take advantage of perl modules and extensions, then
you can run ./configure --disable-perl
