Thank you for downloading NeoStats. 

NeoStats is a powerful and extendable set of *services* for IRC. By 
Services, we do not mean NickServ/Chanserv etc but additional services. 
These additional services include things like StatServ which gives you 
statistics on the number of users/operators/channels/servers, and
MoraleServ, which is a *fun* module, to send funny messages to users, 
and utility modules. Some modules have a useful function on your 
network, other modules are developed for fun, and to make your IRC 
network more attractive to users.

The 3.0 series of NeoStats offers many improvements over previous 
versions. A detailed list of changes can be found in the ChangeLog file, 
but a brief summary is:
    - Simplified configure, build and install process.
    - Improved debug mode to provide information to us more easily in
      the event of problems and avoid polluting general logs with
      debug information.
    - New segfault log file to log any segfaults which occur with
      NeoStats for better support.
    - New and improved API for module coders.
    - Many updates to the various modules.
    - New backend database storage based on standard DBM systems.
    - New athentication modules and API to allow custom authentication.
    - Improved protocol module API to make it easier to add support for
      other IRCds.
    - Many optimisations of the core to speed up NeoStats operation and
      reduce the resource requirements. 
    - DCC chat support to allow users to operate NeoStats via a DCC chat
      session.
    - Native Windows support including full support for modules.
    - All commands have configurable user levels.
    - Perl API, so you can write new modules or extend existing modules
      in the Perl Scripting Language
    - Automatic notification of new versions, when they become available
    - a large range of supported IRCd's

1. Installing and configuring NeoStats
--------------------------------------

This section explains how to install and configure NeoStats. We 
recommend that you read this section in full before trying to install 
NeoStats.

If you have any problems NOT addressed in this or other documents, 
please see the Support section for how to contact us for help.


1.1 General notes
-----------------

All commands and filenames are case sensitive. This means that 
NeoStats, neostats and NEOSTATS are all different things. When 
typing commands you should use the same case as provided in this 
file or things will not work correctly.


1.2 Getting Started
-------------------

First, you need to uncompress NeoStats. To do this type the following:

        tar xvfz NeoStats3.0.x.tar.gz 

This will vary depending on the version you run of NeoStats. Change the 
x in NeoStats3.0.x.tar.gz to match your filename e.g. 

        NeoStats3.0.0.tar.gz

For systems that don't run a new version of tar you need to do this:

        gzip -d NeoStats3.0.x.tar.gz
        tar xvf NeoStats3.0.x.tar

1.3 Running configure
---------------------

You must first run the configure script so that NeoStats can determine
your build environment.

To run configure, you must first change to the directory where you 
uncompressed NeoStats. e.g.

        cd ~/NeoStats3.0.0

Your prompt should look something like:
    
        [user@host NeoStats3.0.0]

Now type:
    
        ./configure
        
The configure script will then check to see if all necessary programs to 
run NeoStats are installed on your system. 

Optional settings:
------------------

There are some options you can pass to configure if you wish. 

Debugging:

Most users will never look at this option. It compiles NeoStats 
with debugging turned on. I would only suggest using this if you 
have problems and are about to make a bug report.

        --enable-debug        Enables Debugging

Enabling RAW command:

We strongly recommend against the use of this option. Use of RAW 
commands can cause desync on your network and badly formatted commands 
can crash your network. If you do enable this option, we will not 
provide any support for your use of this command. Please do not contact 
us for support of the RAW command.

        --enable-raw 


1.4 Compiling NeoStats
----------------------

You should now be back at a shell prompt, type:

        make

it will go through the source and compile it into an executable 
binary file. 


1.5 Installing NeoStats
-----------------------

If you are upgrading a working version of NeoStats. Please read section 
1.9 Notes for Upgraders now.

NeoStats must be "installed" into its own directory. By default NeoStats 
will install into ~/NeoStats3.0/ i.e. in your home directory e.g.

        /home/fish/NeoStats3.0/
    
If you wish to change the install location, please type 

		./configure --help
		
and follow the instructions on screen.

To install NeoStats type:

        make install

This will create the necessary files, and copy them to the 
installation directory. 


1.6 Setting up the neostats.conf file
-------------------------------------

Now you should change to the installation directory (~/NeoStats/, or 
whatever you specified in ./configure) e.g.

        cd ~/NeoStats3.0

Your prompt should look something like:
    
        [user@host NeoStats3.0]

Once in this directory, you need to create a configuration file. You
should now run the makeconf script and answer the questions:
    
        ./bin/makeconf

You must edit neostats.conf to check that everything is set the way you 
want it before NeoStats will run. You can do this with:

        pico neostats.conf

All the options are described in the neostats.conf file and you should
refer to this file for assistance. 

When you are finished, save the file. If using pico as in the previous 
example, press Ctrl-X then hit Y and enter to save the file and exit.

1.7 Compiling additional modules
--------------------------------

If you have downloaded other NeoStats modules e.g. OPSB, you should now 
install them. If you are upgrading NeoStats, you must rebuild all other 
separate modules to work with the new version of NeoStats. See the 
documentation with these modules for instructions on building and 
installing them. 

Modules written for previous series of NeoStats will not work with the 
3.0 series. You must contact the module author for an updated version of 
the module. All official modules have a 3.0 compatible version available.

1.8 Running NeoStats
--------------------

NeoStats is now configured and installed. 

Before running NeoStats you must make sure that your server(s) have C: 
N: and U: lines for your NeoStats server. 
WE WILL NOT ASSIST YOU WITH ADDING C: N: AND U: LINES TO YOUR SERVER, 
YOU SHOULD READ THE IRCD DOCUMENTATION IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO DO 
IT!!! DO NOT CONTACT US ABOUT C: N: and U: Lines

Once your C/N/U lines are setup, you need to start NeoStats. You should 
change to the directory where NeoStats in installed e.g.

        cd ~/NeoStats3.0

Then to run NeoStats type:

        ./neostats start

It should link and sync with your server in a matter of seconds.

Please now read
http://wiki.neostats.net/confluence/display/NeoStats/Operator+Manual
for details on how to operate NeoStats from an IRC Client.

If anything goes wrong, there *might* be an error message in the log 
files. Have a look in ~/NeoStats3.0/logs/neostats-date.log it might give 
you a clue to what's wrong! NeoStats might also send a wallops to the 
network about what went wrong. Check the status window of your IRC client. 

There are some command line options for NeoStats that you may find
useful:

    -h        will display a help screen showing these options.
    -v        will display the version number
    -d 1-10   Enable debugging output 1 = lowest, 10 = highest
    -n        Do not load any modules on startup
    -q        Quiet start - for cron scripts
    -f        Do not fork into background (for debugging)

To use these options, add the option(s) you require when you run 
NeoStats, e.g.:

	./neostats start -h
	
Note: although you can combine most of these options, -v (version)
and -h (help) will return information to you and NeoStats will not
process any other options you pass. 	


1.9 Notes for upgraders
-----------------------

This section is for users upgrading a NeoStats 3.0 series installation
only. If you are upgrading from an older series of NeoStats such as 
2.5.x, you must treat it as a new installation. Your configuration and
data from 2.5.x is not compatible with NeoStats 3.0. 

If you are upgrading from an older version of the 3.0 series we 
recommend that you backup the current version first. 

If you are running crontab for NeoStats, we recommend that you disable 
this before making the upgrade so that cron does not start up an older
versopn while you are working on the upgrade. 

Make sure that NeoStats is not running. In an IRC client connected to 
your network type:

        /msg NeoStats shutdown Upgrade

NeoStats will save important information so wait for this to finish. 

To make the backup go to your home directory and type:

        cp NeoStats3.0 NeoStatsBackup -r

If you fail to perform this backup and the upgrade causes you problems, 
you might lose all NeoStats information. 

We also recommend rebuilding any additional modules after upgrading
NeoStats. You may not need to upgrade the additional module, just 
rebuild and reinstall it after the make install in Step 1.4 above.

If after upgrading, NeoStats crashes when loading one of your modules 
e.g. OPSB, this usually means that you did not rebuild the module for 
the latest version of NeoStats. 

If you do run into problems upgrading and need to restore your backup, 
you can do so by going to your home directory and typing:

        cp NeoStatsBackup NeoStats3.0 -r

Your old modules will also be restored along with the old version of
NeoStats so there is no need to rebuild them for a restore.

2 Support Information
---------------------

2.1 Before contacting support
-----------------------------

** IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ BEFORE CONTACTING US **

In order that we can dedicate time to developing NeoStats and can address 
support issues quickly, there are some ways you can help to reduce 
unnecessary support calls to the NeoStats team. 

First, check you are using the latest release version of NeoStats as found on 
the NeoStats download page. It could be that your problem is fixed or your 
suggestion implemented in the latest version. We are not able to provide 
support for older versions of NeoStats than the current release. 

We provide no support for SVN snapshots whether released on the web site or 
not. If you have downloaded a SVN snapshot and are having problems, you should 
revert back to your previous working version or if this is your first 
installation, the current release build as indicated on the web site. Please 
do not contact us about problems with SVN versions. We will advise users 
occasionally to try a SVN snapshot to fix a problem, but as we do not put our 
SVN versions through extensive testing, there might be new bugs or problems. 

We may occasionally provide a custom modification to resolve a problem. Other 
than in this event, we provide no support for modified versions of NeoStats. 
If you have modified NeoStats in any way and experience problems, you should 
only contact us if you can reproduce the problem with an unmodified version. 
We are not able to support modifications to NeoStats made by others. 

Before contacting us with a problem or a bug, please make sure you have read 
all the documentation provided. You should then check the web site bug list 
and search the forums to see if your problem has already been reported and if 
a solution has been posted. 

Read the log files. NeoStats tries to log problems it encounters and the log
file should tell you what went wrong. If the error in the log file does not 
help you, you still need to tell us what it says.

Before sending us a suggestion, you should check the forums carefully to see 
if your suggestion has already been made and if the NeoStats team have decided 
to implement it or not. 

You do not have to read all the messages to find out if your issue has 
already been discussed. The use of the "Search" feature on the forums is a 
great way to quickly get answers to your problem if other users have already 
encountered the issue. 

Read the post entitled Bug Reporting Guidelines in the forum before posting.
This is at the top of all the support forums. It reminds you what 
information you must provide to get support.

NeoStats Group are only able to help with issues affecting NeoStats. We are 
not able to help set up your IRC Server or Services on your network (including 
the setup of C: N: and U: lines) so please don't ask us. If you have a 
question about your IRC Server or Services package, please check the 
documentation that came with them and contact their team if you still need 
assistance. 

The RAW command is an unsupported command. If you need help using it, you 
should probably not be using it. Please do not ask us for help on the RAW 
command.

Thank you. 


2.1 Where to get support
------------------------

You can get support for NeoStats in a number of different ways so choose
the one that suits you best.

* Bug reporting system
You can check this to see if there are any known bugs in NeoStats and 
find out when they are fixed. For the bug tracking system, visit:

        http://bugs.neostats.net/

* Message boards available at:

        http://www.neostats.net/boards/

* The Neostats Wiki available at:
	http://wiki.neostats.net/confluence/display/NeoStats/

* The NeoStats IRC support channel at:

        server:  irc.irc-chat.net 
        channel: #neostats

Be warned that we are not always available on the channel to help you. 

2.2 What to provide when requesting support
-------------------------------------------

It always helps to provide as much information as possible about your 
environment when asking for help. Please make sure you include at least 
the following information:
    
    Operating system version (i.e., Redhat 7.0, Mandrake 9.1 etc)
    gcc version (found via gcc -v)
    Version of NeoStats you are using and if the problem is with a 
    module, the version of the module (found via /msg neostats modlist)
    The type of IRCD you are attempting to connect to (and version 
    number)
    NeoStats will generate a file called segfault.log if it crashes. If
    this file exists, you must send it to us.
    
We may request that you enable debugging and submit us the results of 
debugging. To enable debugging, use the following command to start 
NeoStats:

        ./bin/neostats -d10

When it crashes, or the bug has been reproduced, send the following 
files:
        
        segfault.log 
        logs/debug.log

This will help us to be able to reproduce the bug and create a fix for 
it.

Sometimes we might request you to run a GDB backtrace of the problem
In order to generate that you will execute the following commands:
        
	gdb bin/neostats 

when you arrive at the GDB command prompt, type:

        run -fd 10

now go and make NeoStats crash in some way. when it crashs, you will 
be returned to the GDB command prompt. Type:

	bt full

and save that output to send to us. To exit GDB, just type "quit"        

Remember you cannot give us too much information about your system and
setup, but if you do not give us enough, we cannot help you and if we 
have to keep asking you to provide more information, that is less time
we are spending fixing and developing NeoStats.
