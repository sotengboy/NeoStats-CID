# NeoStats Startup Script
# $Id: cronchk 583 2003-09-20 10:35:54Z Fish $
#
# This is a script suitable for use in a crontab or starting NeoStats
# It checks to make sure NeoStats is configured correctly
# and also starts/stops NeoStats, and checks that neostats is running from
# when executed frm cron.
#
# To Start NeoStats, just execute this script
# 
# To check that neostats is running, put the following line in your 
# crontab:
#    0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * *   @prefix@/neostats -c 
# change this to the mail address to mail output to:
#MAIL=me

# End of User Configuration

# change this to the directory you run your ircd from:
dir="@prefix@"

# change this to the name of your Neostats file in that directory:

# I wouldn't touch this if I were you.
