NeoStats ChangeLog - Anything we add/remove/fix/change is in here (even our rants)
=====================================================================================
* NeoStats * Fish (F) & Mark (M) * Version 2.5.15
 - Remove sprotocol_cmd since it is very ircd specfic (M)
 - Initialize me.now at bootup so we do not get random timestamps (M)
 - Fix Unreal PROTOCTL sending so it works correctly (M)
 - Add correct sjoin support to Unreal  (M)
 - Introduce new ssjoin_cmd for sjoin processing (M)
 - Fix midnight detection in core (M)
 - kick_chan tidyups (M)
 - Trap and silently drop (but log) CTCP commands send to NeoStats (M)
 - tidy up of various error messages to help with tracking problems (M)
 - Log message when no configured modules in neostats.cfg (M)
 - UMODE_CH_xxxx defines for Smodes changed to SMODE_CH_xxxx (M)
 - Fix a off by one error in quit messages (F)
 - Temp fix for kick_chan when its a server performing the kick (BugID 108) (F)
 - Increaes Storage Size for AddStringToList (F)
 - Update all ircd channel modes, user modes, messages and tokens (M)
 - Change ircd command processing to be more efficient and easier to maintain (M)
 - Add support for storing server info line (M)
 - Add support for hostmasking (M)
 - Improve TS processing (M)
 - Simplified IRCd support so they are easier to maintain and to port new ircds.
   All outgoing messages go through send_xxx (e.g. send_notice) which just formats
   the message as required for the ircd. All incoming messages now go through one
   set of calls instead of two. An additional parameter srv states whether this was
   a server message or not for when a command needs different handling (e.g. nick).
   All such calls renamed to m_xxx e.g. m_nick to match ircd naming conventions
   so we can easily find in ircd source. Most of these calls now just need to format 
   the incoming text and let the NeoStats core process it (M)
 - Added NICKV2 and UMODE2 support to Unreal (M)
 - Set segv_module before calling bot chan messages (M)
 - Added servicests support to Unreal and core (M)
 - New style splif buffer function introduced to save splits and joins (M)
 - Added system to overide the core parse and splitbuf functions for IRCu; will merge 
   back into core when IRCu support complete (M)
 - Bug fix in NICKV2 for Unreal; realname was not parsed properly (M)
 - Privmsg checks moved to ircd command lists and core function provided for processing (M)
 - Add notice check to ircd command lists (M)
 - Cleaned up bot message and bot chan message handling (M)
 - Main services bot is not a mod_usr which tidies up command processing and let's NeoStats 
   show up in bot channel lists (M)
 - Optimise core CTCP checks to avoid unnecessary processing (M)
 - Add numeric support to server structures (M)
 - Added a "Global" exclusion list to NeoStats so we can maintain a single exclusion list, instead of multiple ones like we have now with opsb, and SecureServ.
 - Added strnow to me structure. This is a string version of me.now. (M)
 - don't add a uplink to the NeoStats server struct, as this breaks statserv map (F)
 - StatServ now uses GeoIP database from maxmind. More accurate now that previous, as we can calculate location based on IP address and not DNS (F)
 - Fix the exclusion macro, & not && (M)
 - New IsMe macro and associated user and server flags. We can now detect NeoStats users/servers without a string compare (M)
 - Tidy up set and reset of segv_inmodule (M)
 - Valgrind Fixes. Some. Not All. Long way to go (F)
 - Add Viagra IRCD support contributed by OvErRiTe (M)
 - Tidy up makefiles and build process (M)
 - Add OpenBSD support (M)
 - Add wrappers fo dlxxx calls so we can support a.out and OSes requiring leading underscore on symbols (M)
 - Report errors for missing admin.motd fails in an appropriate manner with ERR_ numerics (M)
 - Introduce new file (neostats.h) to export API to modules. This will replace 
   the stats.h and dl.h that we use at the moment and bring in functions from 
   other headers that we export but should be restricted to the core. Why a new
   file? It allows us to track propogation to modules and maintain backward 
   compatibility more easily (M)
 - Port core modules to use neostats.h and tidy up includes (M)
 - Add SVSTIME support so NeoStats can resolve TS problems - currently Unreal only (M)
 - Add IRCu P10 support (M)
 - Add support for Unreal's SWHOIS (M)
 - Add core support to store network ban info (M)
 - Add support for Unreal TKL bans (M)
 - New bot flag so bots can ignore channel messages when they do not need them (M)
 - Fix IRCu parsing and begin merging back to core (M)
 - Changed debug dump outputs to be more readable and make helper functions for 
   each dump type instead of having the dump code written twice (M)
 - SERVERDUMP now takes an optional parameter of server name to work like chan/userdump (M)
 - Add new version information for checking modules and the core are compatible (M)
 - TLDmap for statserv now works on IRCd's that don't send a IP address in the connect Message (Unreal etc) (F)
 - Core will now lookup ip addresses of users connecting to the network if the IRCd doesn't specify it, and a module says it wants it (StatServ, and port OPSB over as well) (F)
 - StatServ now exports the TLD data to SqlSrv (F)
 - Added more types to core command set processor - NICK, USER, HOST, REALNAME, IPV4 and MSG (for multiple strings) (M)
